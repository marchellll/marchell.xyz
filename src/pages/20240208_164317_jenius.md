## What is Jenius?

Jenius is a digital bank in Indonesia, the first one of its kind, launched in 2016.

It was built by BTPN, a traditional bank in Indonesia. It was built to cater to the younger generation, so everything is done within the app, and only in the app. It was a big disruption against banking industry in Indonesia when it was launched, and it still is.

## üèÑüèΩ‚Äç‚ôÇÔ∏è My experience

### Early days

I joined Jenius in 2015, when it was still stealthing. I was hired as Frontend Engineer, building feature for the apps, using native technologies (iOS, Android, Angular). I also doing the backend work using Java Spring.


### Transition to Backend

Some time after the launch, we know for sure that we need to do a major rewrite of the apps and the backend, the development speed was painful. We were short on backend developers, so when my managements offered me to work on backend, I immediately took it. I was part of the team that built the second version of the system on both ends.

### Rewrites and Rewrites

So we moved from native to React Native, and from Java Spring to Node.js. We also moved from monolith to microservices. It was a big transition, and it was a big success. After the change, we can deliver features faster, and we can scale the system easily.

It was a great experience. I learned a lot about how to build a system that can handle a lot of traffic, and how to build a system that can be **easily maintained**. I also learned how to work with cross-functional teams (PO, FE, UI/UX, etc), and how to work with a lot of stakeholders (VP, Senior Managements, etc).
