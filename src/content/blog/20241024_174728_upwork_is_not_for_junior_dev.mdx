I've heard some good testimonies about [Upwork](https://www.upwork.com/nx/find-work/best-matches) in LinkedIn, so I try it.

The first job matches was this. Can you find the problem?

The problem is: it is too good to be true. 650$ just to fix `npm start`.

But I try it anyways. I downloaded the zip file and open the project.

The first thing that I look for is the `package.json`. I want to see the command.

`npm start` will trigger `npm run config`, which will run `node src/optimize.js`

Let's take a look inside `optimize.js`

A bunch of bullshit. I've spend a good 20 minutes reading `https://github.com/testing-library/jest-dom`. Nothing related to this obfuscated file. Looking around the project, it is clear that this script will try to run a malicious code, most probably mining.

Whatever this is, the intention is not good, So quickly flag this listing as a scam.

A junior dev or even an unsuspecting senior will easily fooled, I hope all devs in this platform aware of thes kind of scam and be vigilant.

Today I learned what is the purpose of this VSCode prompt
