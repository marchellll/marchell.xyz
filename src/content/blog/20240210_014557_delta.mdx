You need to show a beautiful git diff to your friend. You can use `git diff` and `git diff --color-words` to show the diff. But, it is not beautiful enough. You can use `delta` to make it more beautiful.

## Install `delta`

```bash
brew install git-delta
```

See the [delta](https://github.com/dandavison/delta) for other installation methods.

## Configure `git` to use `delta`

Add these to your `~/.gitconfig` file.

```ini
# git-delta
# to show beautiful diff
[core]
    pager = delta # comment this line if you don't want to use anymore

[interactive]
    diffFilter = delta --color-only

[delta]
    navigate = true    # use n and N to move between diff sections
    light = false      # set to true if you're in a terminal w/ a light background color (e.g. the default macOS terminal)
    side-by-side = true
    line-numbers = true

[merge]
    conflictstyle = diff3

[diff]
    colorMoved = default
```

## Result

Here is the result of the diff.
